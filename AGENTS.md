# Arch packages

This project is the standalone `vith/arch-packages` GitHub repository.

- Manage GitHub repository settings, environments, permissions, and signing secrets through `opentofu/`. Use `tools/tofu.sh plan -out=github.tfplan`, inspect the plan, then `tools/tofu.sh apply github.tfplan`. Verify a subsequent plan has no changes.
- The wrapper uses the existing GitHub CLI login. Never print credentials. State and saved plans must remain encrypted and gitignored; recovery files live under `~/.local/state/arch-packages/` outside Git.
- Workflow and recipe changes are ordinary version-controlled source files. Do not use repository-file resources to overwrite source history.
- Build each package in its own GitHub-hosted x86_64 workflow run. Publication collects validated outputs and signs the repository; it does not compile packages.
- Never compile packages on the workstation. Local Python tests, shell syntax checks, OpenTofu formatting and validation are appropriate.
- Fetch source Git objects directly from pinned upstream identities. Do not publish Git source bundles.
- Limit changes to this project. Other software repositories and infrastructure have independent ownership and state.
